Future Roadmap
==============

This page outlines ideas and feature directions under consideration.

Streaming & Incremental Updates
-------------------------------

* Incremental per‑chunk updates with cache/eviction policies
* On‑disk serialization for WorkerOuts and Hierarchy snapshots
* IPC or streaming interfaces (e.g., ZeroMQ or shared memory) for online pipelines

Probabilistic Model Enhancements
--------------------------------

* Strict log‑odds operation end‑to‑end (optional)
* Adaptive ``p_unknown`` based on neighborhood statistics
* Confidence/variance bands in addition to mean probabilities

Parallelism & Distribution
--------------------------

* Tuned thread pool (work‑stealing, CPU affinity)
* Optional TBB/OpenMP backends
* MPI‑enabled forest assembly and distributed chunk building

Mapping Policies
----------------

* Gradient/error‑driven refinement triggers
* Feature‑based policies (edges/planes) from input data
* Mixed policies per region with safety clamps for determinism

Integrations & Formats
----------------------

* More flexible OctoMap insertion modes (ray skipping, occupancy clamps per region)
* Out‑of‑core point ingestion (LAS/LAZ, PLY, Parquet at scale)
* Export of forests to additional mesh formats or visualization frameworks

Python & Tooling
----------------

* PyPI release with platform wheels
* Jupyter widgets for interactive slice/level selection
* Animated projections / time‑varying overlays
* Richer test suite for visualization (goldens; perceptual diffs)

Docs & CI
---------

* Autogenerated API docs from C headers and Python docstrings
* Gallery of visualization recipes and presets
* CI matrix with OctoMap/p4est enabled on supported runners
